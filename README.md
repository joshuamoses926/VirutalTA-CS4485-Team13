A chatbot is an AI-based software designed to interact with humans in a natural way.

After years of teaching at UTD , there are several places where information given to the student and
questions asked by students are repetitive. This sometime is overwhelming to instructors and teaching
assistants with high number of students. It will be interesting to develop an AI teaching assistant that can
interact with students and provide basic to complex support.
